Lunar Phase Analog Clock

This is a Watchface for the Pebble Watch.  It displays an analog clock which shows an illustration of moon phase in the background.

When the app loads, it quickly runs though an animation showing 1 full lunar cycle.

The lunar phase label and Moon Illustration are redrawn once per hour.
The hour and minute hands are redrawn once per minute.
The second hand (optional) is redrawn once per second.

The moon phase label cylcles though the following:
    New Moon,
    Waxing Crescent,
    First Quarter,
    Waxing Gibbous,
    Full Moon,
    Waning Gibbous,
    Third Quarter,
    Waning Crescent


Versions

There are several versions to choose from: 

Moon Only (no clock hands)
Analog Clock with second hand
Analog Clock without second hand

Each of the above versions are available with either a solid white moon, or a detailed moon graphic.
